                With more and more locations opening up in the aftermath of the Corona crisis, many event organizers
                face the challenge of verifying the health status of their participants. Some public health authorities
                even mandate event organizers to make sure, that only people of a certain status are allowed on the
                premises.

                Using pretixSCAN on Android (and only on Android), you can now scan a variety of vaccination passports
                and COVID test certificates. The information therein is validated and displayed on the screen of your
                device, allowing for a faster and more comfortable checkin experience.

                No personal identifiable information (PII) is collected through this process. pretix will however save
                the validity of the proof shown in order to minimize the revalidation effort necessary.

                Validating digital vaccination passports and test result certificates is only possible with pretixSCAN 1.11.0 or newer on Android 6.0 or newer!

                Our validation algorithm for digital certificates is based on the official German validation apps.
                Please make sure to regularly update pretixSCAN to make sure you do not miss any changes. Also, if you
                are based in another country, we don't know how well the German validation rules map to the local
                regulations in your country. Please test carefully if this is appropriate for you to use.
