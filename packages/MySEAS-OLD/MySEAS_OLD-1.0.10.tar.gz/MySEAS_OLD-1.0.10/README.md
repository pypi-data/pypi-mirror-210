# SEAS
## Introduction
NOTE: This is under development and does not have many features.
s

This is a python Framework called MySEAS (My Sufficiently exploited and Affordable Script). Its build on top of pygame, thefore the name. In the future you might be able to call it a game engine but right now Its a tool i guess.
It (by the moment) does not have a UI and not many features. Of course u can expect more features in the future.

## Demo
DEMOS/demo.py is a code example of how you can use this. It does not show all of the current features but it's still cool!

## Explaining the code (and more)
Too understand whats going on u can do two things. Use ur brain and see what the functions do or look at the documentation.md.

## Download
The procces to download this is quit simple. Just use pip.
Pip command:
pip install MySEAS (If u know what ur doing u can ofc use pip3)

U can also visit the page on pypi here:
