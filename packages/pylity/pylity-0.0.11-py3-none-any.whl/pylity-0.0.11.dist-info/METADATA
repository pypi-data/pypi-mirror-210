## About

The `pylity` package is a set of utility and common functions for Python.
**pylity** means `Python Utility`.

When we work on different projects, there are usually functions that are **common** between the projects. Functions that we generally call Utility or helpers or something like that. Functions that are **independent** and can be used in different places.

Well, instead of copying and pasting these functions in a new project every time, it is better to have a package that gathers all these together so that we can install and use them **easily**. This is the goal of this project. :)


## Getting Started

### Installation

Use pip to install package:

```shell
pip install pylity --upgrade
```

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Please note that this package uses [on_rails](https://github.com/payadel/on_rails) package for most functions. `on_rails` is an easy and valuable package for better **error management**. If you are not familiar with this package, you should read its documentation.

### Sample

A set of different functions are grouped into related **classes**.
Import any class you want, then use the functions.
For example:

```python
from pylity import Function

Function.is_func_valid(lambda: None)  # returns True

Function.get_num_of_params(lambda a, b, c: None) \
    .on_success(lambda num_of_params: print(f"Number of parameters is: {num_of_params}")) \
    .on_fail(lambda result: print(f"An error occurred:\n{result}"))
```

## CHANGELOG
