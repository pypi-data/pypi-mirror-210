        For a long position, the maximum stop loss is calculated as the maximum value between the stop loss specified in the input dataframe and the entry price multiplied by (1 - 1 / leverage). This ensures that the stop loss is set at a level that is proportional to the leverage used in the trade.
        For a short position, the maximum stop loss is calculated as the minimum value between the stop loss specified in the input dataframe and the entry price multiplied by (1 + 1 / leverage). This ensures that the stop loss is set at a level that is proportional to the leverage used in the trade.
