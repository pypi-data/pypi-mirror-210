A LLAMA search for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave candidate consistent
with the sky localization of IceCube alert {{icecube_alert}} (<link to notice>)
in a time range of 1000 seconds {{citeskymap_number('llama', citation_index)}}
centered on the alert event time
({{tl_datetime}} UTC to {{tl_datetime}} UTC) have been performed.
The hypothesis test employed by LLAMA uses a Bayesian approach to quantify
the joint GW + neutrino event significance. {{citeskymap_number('llama_stat', citation_index)}}

Gravitational-wave candidate {{gracedb_id}} is found to be in spatial and temporal
coincidence with {{icecube_alert}} public alert. The properties of the candidate
event, which based on the analysis of gravitational-wave data alone does not
meet the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA criteria for a high-significance public alert and can
be found at this URL:

{{ gracedb_service_url }}{{ gracedb_id }}

The neutrino trigger time is xxx.xx seconds before(after) the gravitational-wave
candidate event. The p-value associated with the joint observation is {{'%.4g'|format(llama_fap)}}.
We encourage further observation of the localization area of {{icecube_alert}}
and we provide a joint localization probability map at:
