Searches for track-like muon neutrino events detected by IceCube consistent
with the sky localization of gravitational-wave candidate {{gracedb_id}} in a time range
of 1000 seconds {{citeskymap_number('llama', citation_index)}} centered on the alert event time
({{tl_datetime}} UTC to {{th_datetime}} UTC) have been performed.
During this time period IceCube was collecting good quality data. The hypothesis
test employed by LLAMA uses a Bayesian approach to quantify the joint GW + neutrino
event significance. {{citeskymap_number('llama_stat', citation_index)}}

{{neutrinos|length|int}} track-like event{% if neutrinos|length > 1 %}s were{% else %} was{% endif %} found in spatial and temporal coincidence with the
gravitational-wave candidate {{gracedb_id}}. The eventâ€™s properties can be found at
this URL:

Based on the analysis of gravitational-wave data alone, this candidate does not
meet our criteria for a high-significance public alert.

where:
dt = Time offset (sec) of track event with respect to GW trigger.
Angular uncertainty = Angular uncertainty of track event: the radius of a
    circle representing 90% CL containment by area.
p-value = the p-value for this specific track event from each search.
