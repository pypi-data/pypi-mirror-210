Description: See README at https://github.com/water3d/openet/ for more details. Make sure to install package extras (e.g. pip install 'openet-client[spatial]') for spatial data support in the geodatabase API. It depends on Geopandas, which depends on fiona - this can be challenging to get set up correctly, so it's worth checking the documentation for those projects to install on your system, or use a conda environment and install the conda geopandas package.
