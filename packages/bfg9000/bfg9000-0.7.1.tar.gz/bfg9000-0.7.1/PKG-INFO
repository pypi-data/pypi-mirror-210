Description: # bfg9000 - build file generator
        **bfg9000** is a cross-platform *build configuration system* with an emphasis on
        making it easy to define how to build your software. It converts a Python-based
        build script into the appropriate files for your underlying build system of
        choice (Ninja, Make, or MSBuild).
        
        ## Why bfg9000?
        
        #### Familiar syntax
        
        `build.bfg` files are just Python scripts with some new functions added, so you
        may already know how to write them; and when your build gets complicated, you
        can rely on the existing Python ecosystem to get you out of trouble.
        
        #### Fast builds
        
        bfg9000 ensures your builds are fast by relying on existing, mature build
        systems like Make and Ninja to do the heavy lifting of building your software;
        often, incremental builds don't need to execute bfg9000 at all!
        
        #### Stay sane
        
        Building your code shouldn't be the hard part of developing your project. Above
        all else, bfg9000 strives to help you get your build right the *first* time with
        many helpful [features][features].
        
        ## A brief example
        
        You can't get much simpler than the simplest `build.bfg` file:
        
        ```python
        executable('simple', files=['simple.cpp'])
        ```
        
        To build this executable, we need to create the actual build files and then
        run them:
        
        ```sh
        $ cd /path/to/src/
        $ 9k build/
        $ cd build/
        $ ninja
        ```
        
        From there, you can run your newly-created executable: `./simple`. Hooray!
        
        For further examples, please see the [`examples/`][examples] subdirectory.
        
        ## Installation
        
        bfg9000 uses [setuptools][setuptools], so installation is much the same as any
        other Python package:
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install bfg9000
        ```
        
        From there, you can start using bfg to build your software! (If you're using
        Ubuntu, you can also install bfg9000 from the following PPA:
        [ppa:jimporter/stable][ppa]). For more information about how to install bfg9000,
        see the [documentation][getting-started].
