- The default list of excluded globs for `find_files()` can now be customized
  via `project(find_exclude=[...])`

  on other compilers in the family (e.g. if `CXX=g++`, guess that the C compiler
  is `gcc`)
- Add support for `DESTDIR` on Windows when installation paths don't include a
  drive letter
- Regenerating build files with the Ninja backend now uses the `console` pool,
  allowing realtime output and colored text

---

## v0.5.0 (2019-11-25)

### New features
- Add `generated_source()` to allow generating source code from domain-specific
  languages
- Add support for `lex`, `yacc`, and Qt build tools (`moc`, `rcc`, `uic`)
- Add the ability to use placeholders for `build_step()` and `command()`
- Add an `auto_file()` function that infers the kind of file based on its
  extension; `build_step()` now uses this by default for outputs

  `copy_file()`, and their list-variants
- Add `lang` and `intermediate_dirs` arguments to `project()` for modifying
  project-wide settings
- Add `srcdir` builtin to toolchain files

### Breaking changes
- `find_files()` redesigned and split into `find_files()` and `find_paths()`;
  simple cases should still work, but more complex uses will need adjusted
- *pkg-config* `.pc` files generated by bfg9000 no longer include rpath flags
- Explicitly passing `lang` to a build step now overrides the languages of any
  input files when determining the builder

  instead
- Options specified on the command line (e.g. install locations) now override
  settings in toolchain files
- Implicitly-defined object files (e.g. those generated by `executable()`) are
  placed in an intermediate directory; call `project(intermediate_dirs=False)`
  to disable this

### Bug fixes
- Include `options.bfg` in dist tarballs
- Fix escaping of `~` in Makefiles
- Symbolic links (e.g. from versioned shared libraries) are now properly
  installed as symlinks
- Generated header directories are now included as dependencies of compilation

  the host platform, with cross-platform builds defaulting to installation
  disabled
- Shared libraries with `soversion`s can now be used with `pkg_config()`

## v0.4.1 (2019-07-05)

### Bug fixes
- Fix using semantic options in `global_options`

---

## v0.4.0 (2019-07-05)

### New features
- Compilers and linkers now support semantic options, abstracting away the
  differences between compiler flavors

- Add support for module-definition files when linking `.exe` or `.dll` files
- Build steps now have a (customizable) friendly description when using the
  Ninja backend
- Makefiles generated by bfg now have a `clean` target

### Breaking changes
- MSVC builds now automatically set `/EHsc` to improve standards-compliance and
  mimic Visual Studio's default MSBuild configuration
- Paths are now parsed in a platform-agnostic manner, which may cause issues for
  certain esoteric pathnames (e.g. POSIX paths that look like Windows paths)
- `env.platform` has been split into `env.host_platform` and
  `env.target_platform`
- MinGW now makes DLLs named `<name>.dll` instead of `lib<name>.dll`
- Platform names are reworked; `'windows'` is now `'winnt'` and `'darwin'` is
  `'macos'`

### Bug fixes
- Fix support for packaging as a Python Wheel
- Default options for `ar` are now `cr` instead of `cru` to support versions of
  `ar` that default to deterministic builds

- Fix an issue with creating the build directory during the configuration
  process

---

  resolver: `package()`
- Add `headers` argument to `package()` to find header files and `libs` to
  specify library names if *pkg-config* lookup fails

- Add a `library()` function that builds shared and/or static libraries per the
  user's preference
- Add support for generating *pkg-config* `.pc` files

  and Ruby
- Add `env.run()`, `env.execute()`, and `env.run_arguments()` to simplify
  executing programs during configuration
- Add a `framework()` function to specify macOS frameworks to use for a build
- Improve detection of compiler flavors by checking version information
- Automatically colorize clang/gcc output under Ninja
- Add support for uninstalling builds
- Add `static_link_options` to `static_library()` to specify options to pass to
  the static linker
- Add a `bfg9000 env` command to print the environment variables used during
  configuration
- Automatically request sudo elevation when installing builds to a system
  directory

### Breaking changes
- `directory()` and `header_directory()` no longer automatically include all
  files within them (pass `include='*'` for the old behavior)
- The `include` argument for compiling object files has been replaced by
  `includes`
- When creating a static library, `link_options` now specifies options that will
  be forwarded along to the dynamic linker, rather than options for the static
  linker itself

  any options to the first argument (`cmd`) instead
- `test()` no longer converts its first argument to a `generic_file()`
- Splitting POSIX shell strings (used for compile and link options as well as
  environment vars on POSIX like `CPPFLAGS`) no longer parses escape characters

### Bug fixes
- Improve logging of syntax errors in `build.bfg` files
- Fix usage of nested shared libraries when linking with GNU ld (via
  `-rpath-link`)
- Installing directories from the srcdir now correctly installs their contents
  to the installation root for that type (e.g. a header directory of `foo/bar`
  installs its contents to `$includedir`)
- Fix generation of dependencies for the `tests` target
- Improve escaping for paths when using Make on Windows (previously users had
  to escape backslashes themselves)
- Fix an issue with quotation marks being stripped for some commands on Windows
  with the Ninja backend

---
