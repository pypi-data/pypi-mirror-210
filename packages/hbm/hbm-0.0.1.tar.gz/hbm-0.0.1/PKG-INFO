### About HBM ###

**Human Body Models (HBM)** is a code base developed by Yansel Gonz√°lez Tejeda for his PhD research at the [Computer Science department](https://informatik.uni-salzburg.at/) at [Paris Lodron University of Salzburg](https://www.uni-salzburg.at). It is a rapid prototyping platform focused on modeling realistic human bodies. It contains generative models based on the successfully SCAPE (TBD) and SMPL models.  **HBM** is written with Python in a tremendously "chatty" way to make it especially easy to understand to people with all academic backgrounds (including those without it - and me!). Note that this code is not recommended for production purposes, you can use it at your own risk though.

**NOTE: This is a work in progress**
Things will probably be wonky for a while. Until the code base becomes stable, you should expect several changes in the future. That being said, no drastic changes are planned.
