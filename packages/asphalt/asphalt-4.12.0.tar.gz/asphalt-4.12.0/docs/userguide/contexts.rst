Working with contexts and resources
===================================

.. py:currentmodule:: asphalt.core

Every Asphalt application has at least one context: the root context. The root context is typically
created by the :func:`~asphalt.core.runner.run_application` function and passed to the root
component. This context will only be closed when the application is shutting down.

Most nontrivial applications will make use of *subcontexts*. A subcontext is a context that has a
parent context. A subcontext can make use of its parent's resources, but the parent cannot access
the resources of its children. This enables developers to create complex services that work
together without risking interfering with each other.

Subcontexts can be roughly divided into two types: long lived and short lived ones. Long lived
subcontexts are typically used in container components to isolate its resources from the rest of
the application. Short lived subcontexts, on the other hand, usually encompass some *unit of work*
(UOW). Examples of such UOWs are:

* handling of a request in a network service
* running a scheduled task
* running a test in a test suite

Contexts are "activated" by entering them using ``async with Context():``, and exited by leaving
that block. When entered, the previous active context becomes the parent context of the new one and
the new context becomes the currently active context. When the ``async with`` block is left, the
previously active context once again becomes the active context. The currently active context can
be retrieved using :func:`~.context.current_context`.

.. warning:: Activating contexts in asynchronous generators can lead to corruption of the context
             stack. This is particularly common in asynchronous pytest fixtures because pytest
             helper libraries such as pytest-asyncio_ run the async generator using two different
             tasks. In such cases the workaround is to activate the context in the actual test
             function.

Adding resources to a context
-----------------------------

The resource system in Asphalt exists for two principal reasons:

* To avoid having to duplicate configuration
* To enable sharing of pooled resources, like database connection pools

Here are a few examples of services that will likely benefit from resource sharing:

* Database connections
* Remote service handles
* Serializers
* Template renderers
* SSL contexts

When you add a resource, you should make sure that the resource is discoverable using any
abstract interface or base class that it implements. This is so that consumers of the service don't
have to care if you switch the implementation to another. For example, consider a mailer service,
provided by asphalt-mailer_. The library has an abstract base class for all mailers,
``asphalt.mailer.api.Mailer``. To facilitate this loose coupling of services, it adds all its
configure mailer services using the ``Mailer`` interface so that components that just need *some*
way to send email don't have to care what implementation was chosen in the configuration.

Resources can be added to a context in two forms: static resources and resource factories.
A static resource can be any arbitrary object (except ``None``). The same object can be
added to the context under several different types, as long as the type/name combination
remains unique within the same context.

A resource factory is a callable that takes a :class:`~asphalt.core.context.Context` as
an argument an returns the value of the resource. There are at least a couple reasons to
use resource factories instead of static resources:

  * the resource's lifecycle needs to be bound to the local context (example: database
    transactions)
  * the resource requires access to the local context (example: template renderers)

Getting resources from a context
--------------------------------

The :class:`~asphalt.core.context.Context` class offers a few ways to look up resources.

The first one, :meth:`~asphalt.core.context.Context.get_resource`, looks for a resource or resource
factory matching the given type and name. If the resource is found, it returns its value.

The second one, :meth:`~asphalt.core.context.Context.require_resource`, works exactly the same way
except that it raises :exc:`~asphalt.core.context.ResourceNotFound` if the resource is not found.

The third method, :meth:`~asphalt.core.context.Context.request_resource`, calls
:meth:`~asphalt.core.context.Context.get_resource` and if the resource is not found, it waits
indefinitely for the resource to be added to the context or its parents. When that happens, it
calls :meth:`~asphalt.core.context.Context.get_resource` again, at which point success is
guaranteed. This is usually used only in the components'
:meth:`~asphalt.core.component.Component.start` methods to retrieve resources provided
by sibling components.

The order of resource lookup is as follows:

#. search for a resource in the local context
#. search for a resource factory in the local context and its parents and, if found, generate the
   local resource
#. search for a resource in the parent contexts

Injecting resources to functions
--------------------------------

A type-safe way to use context resources is to use `dependency injection`_. In Asphalt, this is
done by adding parameters to a function so that they have the resource type as the type annotation,
and a :func:`~.context.resource` instance as the default value. The function then needs to be
decorated using :func:`~.context.inject`::

    from asphalt.core import inject, resource

    @inject
    async def some_function(some_arg, some_resource: MyResourceType = resource()):
        ...

To specify a non-default name for the dependency, you can pass that name as an argument to
:func:`~.context.resource`::

    @inject
    async def some_function(some_arg, some_resource: MyResourceType = resource('alternate')):
        ...

Resources can be declared to be optional too, by using either :data:`~typing.Optional`
or ``| None`` (Python 3.10+ only)::

    @inject
    async def some_function(some_arg, some_resource: Optional[MyResourceType] = resource('alternate')):
        ...  # some_resource will be None if it's not found

Restrictions:

* The resource arguments must not be positional-only arguments
* The resources (or their relevant factories) must already be present in the context
  stack (unless declared optional) when the decorated function is called, or otherwise
  :exc:`~.context.ResourceNotFound` is raised

Handling resource cleanup
-------------------------

Any code that adds resources to a context is also responsible for cleaning them up when the context
is closed. This usually involves closing sockets and files and freeing whatever system resources
were allocated. This should be done in a *teardown callback*, scheduled using
:meth:`~asphalt.core.context.Context.add_teardown_callback`. When the context is closed, teardown
callbacks are run in the reverse order in which they were added, and always one at a time, unlike
with the :class:`~asphalt.core.event.Signal` class. This ensures that a resource that is still in
use by another resource is never cleaned up prematurely.

For example::

    from asphalt.core import Component, Context


    class FooComponent(Component):
        async def start(self, ctx: Context) -> None:
            service = SomeService()
            await service.start(ctx)
            ctx.add_teardown_callback(service.stop)
            ctx.add_resource(service)


There also exists a convenience decorator, :func:`~asphalt.core.context.context_teardown`, which
makes use of asynchronous generators::

    from __future__ import annotations
    from collections.abc import AsyncGenerator
    from asphalt.core import Component, Context, context_teardown


    class FooComponent(Component):
        @context_teardown
        async def start(self, ctx: Context) -> AsyncGenerator[None, BaseException | None]:
            service = SomeService()
            await service.start(ctx)
            ctx.add_resource(service)

            yield

            # This part of the function is run when the context is closing
            service.stop()

Sometimes you may want the cleanup to know whether the context was ended because of an unhandled
exception. The one use that has come up so far is committing or rolling back a database
transaction. This can be achieved by passing the ``pass_exception`` keyword argument to
:meth:`~asphalt.core.context.Context.add_teardown_callback`::

    class FooComponent(Component):
        async def start(self, ctx: Context) -> None:
            def teardown(exception: Optional[BaseException]):
                if exception:
                    db.rollback()
                else:
                    db.commit()

            db = SomeDatabase()
            await db.start(ctx)
            ctx.add_teardown_callback(teardown, pass_exception=True)
            ctx.add_resource(db)

The same can be achieved with :func:`~asphalt.core.context.context_teardown` by storing the yielded
value::

    class FooComponent(Component):
        @context_teardown
        async def start(self, ctx: Context) -> AsyncGenerator[None, BaseException | None]:
            db = SomeDatabase()
            await db.start(ctx)
            ctx.add_resource(db)

            exception = yield

            if exception:
                db.rollback()
            else:
                db.commit()

If any of the teardown callbacks raises an exception, the cleanup process will still continue, but
at the end a :exc:`~asphalt.core.context.TeardownError` will be raised. This exception contains all
the raised exceptions in its ``exceptions`` attribute.
