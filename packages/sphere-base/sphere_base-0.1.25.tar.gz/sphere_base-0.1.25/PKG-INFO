- Customizable spheres with textures and colors
- Nodes, sockets and edges can be dragged over the surface of the sphere
- Support for undo/redo, cut and paste using serialization
- Hovering effects, dragging nodes, cutting edges
- Background skybox image can be changed
- Sphere color and texture can be changed
- Example on how the library can be implemented
