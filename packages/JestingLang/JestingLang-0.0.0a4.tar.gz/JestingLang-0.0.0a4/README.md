# INTRODUCTION

***Jesting Language*** is a minimalist functional language, 
intended to be compatible with Spreedsheet syntax found 
in Microsoft's Excel, Libre Office's Calc or Google's 
Sheets. As such, it can be considered a subset of the 
lenguages used in those programs, but lacking many of the 
rich syntax and functions they use.

It was created for the JESTING tool, a Python program 
that emulates behaviour similar to those Spreedsheet 
Applications using Curses.

I happened to find myself working with esoteric uses for the 
spreedsheet syntax, and it turns out that if TDD was in order,
the most entertaining way to do it was with python.

# Syntax and AST

The Jesting Lang syntax follows the standard used by most
spreedsheets programs, allowing simple operations (+, -, *
, /, =, & ), the **IF token** (to allow branching), the use of 
indirections to other cells such as A2 (key behaviour or
spreedhseets) and the **INDIRECT token** (to give more power to 
those indirections)

For example

    = 1 + 1 -> becomes 2
    = "A" & "B" -> becomes AB
    = "A" & 2 -> becomes A2
    = A2 -> becomes an indirection to cell A2
    = INDIRECT("A" & 2) -> becomes an indirection to cell A2
    = IF(0 = 0 , 2 , 3) -> becomes 3

The AST can become more complex, with nodes such as 
*EmptyValue* or *DateValue*. However, they can be easily
solved by using the Visitors provided in this library.
