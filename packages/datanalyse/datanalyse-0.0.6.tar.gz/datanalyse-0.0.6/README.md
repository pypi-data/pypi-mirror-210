# datanalyse

The package name datanalyse is a suitcase word for data and analyse - mainly of experimental data from the Combined Energy Lab at TU Dresden, but perhaps useful for others as well. However, due to its absolute alpha status, I cannot recommend it to anybody in the world but me.

It is more or less a tool-kit for my daily work as an experimentalist and data scientist and makes use of the fantastic packages pandas, pathlib and matplotlib.
