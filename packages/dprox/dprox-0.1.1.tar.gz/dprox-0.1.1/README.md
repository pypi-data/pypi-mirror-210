> $\nabla$-Prox is a domain-specific language (DSL) and compiler that transforms optimization problems into differentiable proximal solvers. Departing from handwriting these solvers and differentiating via autograd, $\nabla$-Prox requires only a few lines of code to define a solver that can be *specialized based on user requirements w.r.t memory constraints or training budget* by optimized algorithm unrolling, deep equilibrium learning, and deep reinforcement learning. $\nabla$-Prox makes it easier to prototype different learning-based bi-level optimization problems for a diverse range of applications. We compare our framework against existing methods with naive implementations. $\nabla$-Prox is significantly more compact in terms of lines of code and compares favorably in memory consumption in applications across domains.

**[Jan 21 2023]**  Release preview code.

> ðŸš§ The code is still under construction, more features would be migrated from our dev code.

## Getting Started

### Solver construction

Consider a simple image deconvlution problem, where we seek to find a clean image $x$ given the blurred observation $y$ that minimizes the following objective function:

$$
\arg \min_x { \frac{1}{2} |Dx - y|^2_2 + g(x) }
$$

where $g(x)$ denotes an implicit plug-and-play denoiser prior. We could solve this problem in âˆ‡-Prox with the following code: 

```python
from dprox import *
from dprox.utils import *
from dprox.utils.examples import *

img = sample()
psf = point_spread_function(15, 5)
b = blurring(img, psf)

x = Variable()
data_term = sum_squares(conv(x, psf) - b)
reg_term = deep_prior(x, denoiser='ffdnet_color')
prob = Problem(data_term + reg_term)

out = prob.solve(method='admm', x0=b)
```

Here is what we got,
