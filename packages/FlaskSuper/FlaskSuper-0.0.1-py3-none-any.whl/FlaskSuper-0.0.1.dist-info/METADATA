## Installation

You can install FlaskPlus using pip:

```

This command will generate the necessary directory structure and files for your web app, including an index.html template and a basic Flask app setup.

After running the command, you will see the following output:

Creating an app...
You can now navigate to the project directory and start building your web application.

The App.py file contains the basic Flask application setup, and the html directory contains the index.html template for your app's homepage.

Building and Running the App

python App.py
This will start the Flask development server, and you can access your app in the browser at http://localhost:5000.

You can now start building your web application by defining routes, creating HTML templates, and adding additional functionality using the FlaskPlus framework.
