    Base Settings class. For all class properties defined there will be a corresponding
    _settings_field["name"] = SettingsField created value that will control how this value is
    read and manipulated.

    The purpose of the Settings class is to allow a library or project/service to define a
    number of settings that are needed in order to function. You define a number of Settings
    propertiess to indicate what settings are available to use in the project.

    You define a Settings and properties very similar to how you define a dataclass. You specify
    a property name, type_hint, and default_value.

    >>> class MySettings(BaseSettings):
    ...    name: type_hint = default_value

    A default `SettingsField` will be configured using the name, type_hint, and default_value as
    follows -- `SettingsField(name=name, type_hint=type_hint, converter=type_hint,
    default_value=default_value, resolver=default_resolver)`

    This functionality can be overridden by setting the default_value to a custom `SettingsField`.
    The custom `SettingsField` will be merged with the default `SettingsField` overriding any
    fields that were defined in the custom SettingsField.

    It's important to note that while we are setting these attributes on the class they will not
    remain as attributes on the class. The _SettingsMeta will take each attribute and convert
    them to a SettingsField and then place them in the class's _setting_fields attribute.

    Example of various ways to allocate a SettingsField on a Settings subclass:

    >>> class MySettings(BaseSettings):
    ...     setting_1: int
    Allocates
    >>> SettingsField(name="setting_1", type_hint=int, resolver=SettingsResolver)

    >>> class MySettings(BaseSettings):
    ...     setting_1: int = 3
    Allocates
    >>> SettingsField(name="setting_1", type_hint=int, resolver=SettingsResolver, default_value=3)

    >>> class MySettings(BaseSettings):
    ...     setting_1 = 3
    Allocates
    >>> SettingsField(name="setting_1", type_hint=int, resolver=SettingsResolver, default_value=3)

    >>> class MySettings(BaseSettings):
    ...     setting_1: int = SettingsField(name="other", required=False)
    Allocates
    >>> SettingsField(name="other", type_hint=int, resolver=SettingsResolver, required=False)

    ## Accessing Class (not instance) Attributes = Lazy Property Reference

    You can do lazy forward-refrences by simply asking the Settings class (not instance) for a
    attribute. Doing so will return a `SettingsClassProperty` that is a forward reference to the
    singleton instance class attribute.

    Examples of how you might use this

    >>> class MySettings(BaseSettings):
    ...    my_url_setting: str
    >>> class MySubSettings(BaseSettings):
    ...    my_field: str
    >>> class SomeClass:
    ...    some_attr = MySettings.my_url_setting
    >>>
    >>> MySettings.grab().my_url_setting = "my-url"
    >>> MySubSettings.grab().my_field = MySettings.my_url_setting
    >>>
    >>> assert SomeClass.some_attr == "my-url"
    >>> assert MySubSettings.grab().some_attr == "my-url"
    >>> assert MySettings.grab().some_attr == "my-url"

    ## Setting public Class Attributes after creation time not allowed
    Attempting to set a public class level attribute will result in an Error being raised.

    ## Settings Attribute (Property) Inheritance not allowed
    To keep things as simple as possible we don't allow SettingsClass attribute inheritance. You
    can however create a parent class that defines methods / @properties that can be inherited.
    Trying to set a regular (non-method/non-property/public) attribute will raise an error.

    ## Accessing Instance Properties = Get Value and Convert
    When calling MySettings.grab().my_setting the Settings class will attempt to retrieve and
    convert the corresponding value. Getting the the source value and converting the value is
    controlled by the SettingsField. Here is how it works.

    Start by attempting to retrieve a property from the class instance
    >>> MyClass.grab().my_setting

    The Settings class will do the following
    1. Attempt to retrieve a value.
       a. Lookup value from self via `object.__getattribute__(self, key)`
       b. If an AttributeError is thrown then lookup the value from the corresponding field
       via `self._settings_field[name].get_value()`
    2. Convert the retrieved value by calling `self._settings_field[name].convert_value(value)`

    .. todo:: We don't support property setters/deleters at the moment.
              We would need to implement a `__setattr__` here, where it would check
              for a property setter/getter on field object.
