# NetDEM

## Welcome

[**NetDEM**](https://apaam.github.io/netdem_docs/) is a C++ program library targeted at the computational mechanics of irregular granular materials and utilizing machine learning tools to boost the computational effciency.

It is currently capable of performing basic and general DEM simulations, with following features:

- Sphere and triangle facets contact solver
- GJK contact solver for convex particles
- SDF contact solver for arbitrary (convex and concave) particles
- Hybrid OpenMP and MPI parallel computing
- Integrated [mlpack](https://www.mlpack.org/) machine learning environment

The supported particle shapes include ``sphere``, ``cylinder``, ``poly-super-ellipsoid``, ``poly-super-quadrics``, ``spherical harmonics``, ``triangle mesh``, ``level set``, etc.

## Get started

### Install

#### Prerequisites 

The compilation requires ``gcc``, ``autoconf``, ``automake``, ``cmake``, ``mpi``, ``boost``, which can be obtained using

```
# For MacOS: use brew install, such as
brew install gcc autoconf autoconf-archive automake cmake openmpi boost
        
# For Ubuntu: use apt-get install, such as
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get install -y autoconf-archive automake cmake texinfo
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libboost-all-dev libomp-dev
```

#### Compile and build

```
make sync_submodule
make
``` 

If some third-party libraries have not been or cannot be downloaded successfully, you can delete them and do a ``git checkout contrib`` and ``make sync_submodule`` again.


#### Test the installation

```
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

### Examples & tutorials

Some preliminary examples are located under directory ``examples/``, which can be run with, e.g.,

```
./build/bin/netdem_example_random_packing 1
```

For more details please refer to the [website](https://apaam.github.io/netdem_docs/).

### Visualize & post-process

Results can be dumped as VTK files, which can be visualized in [paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).

Plese refer to ``tools/post_process`` for some matlab or python scripts for post-process (e.g., VTK io, stress-strain, spherical histograms of contact anisotropy).
