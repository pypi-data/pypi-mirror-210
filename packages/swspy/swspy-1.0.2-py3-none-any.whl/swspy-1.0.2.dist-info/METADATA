# swspy

A package for performing shear wave splitting in an automated manner. Based on the eigenvalue method of Silver and Chan (1991), with multi-windowing of Teanby et al (2004), coordinate system transformations from Walsh et al (2013), automation methods based on Wustefeld et al (2010), and some other additions.
