# sciform

This package is used to format floats into scientific presentation 
formats. Features include fixed point, and decimal and binary scientific 
and engineering notations. Where possible, formatting follows documented 
standards such as those published by [BIPM](https://www.bipm.org/en/) or 
[IEC](https://iec.ch/homepage).

Floats are formatted into strings of the form 
```
mantissa [exp_str]
```
Where `exp_str` can be of the form `exp_symbol exp` where `exp_symbol` 
is `e`,`E`, `b`, or `B`, and `exp` is an integer like `+03`. `exp_str` 
can also be a single SI or IEC "prefix" character like `k` `M` or `Mi`.

Example formatted floats are
- `'103.0400'`
- `'1.03e+02'`
- `'1.03E+03'`
- `'1.03 k'`
- `'1023b+10'`
- `'1.00b+20'`
- `'3.4 Mi'`

In this document, the terminology "precision" of a string representing a 
float is number of digits that appear past the decimal point, e.g. 
`1.030400` has a precision of 6. The number of "significant figures" or 
"sig figs" for a string representing a float is the number of digits 
past the left-most non-zero digit. So `1.030400` has 7 sig figs. The
string `1030` has a precision of 0 and may have 3 or 4 sig figs. When 
presenting a number to a certain number of sig figs, we first round the
number to the digit place corresponding to that number of sig figs
(based on the digit place of the most significant digit) then truncate 
the number to that digit. If that digit is the ones place or larger,
then trailing zeros are added until the ones place.

# Credits
`sciform` was heavily motivated by the float formatting provided in the 
[prefixed](https://github.com/Rockhopper-Technologies/prefixed) and the 
value +/- uncertainty formatting in the 
[uncertainties](https://github.com/lebigot/uncertainties) package.

# Built-in Format Specification Mini Language

In Python, `float` objects can already be converted to string
representations using built in formatting. For example, 
`f'{0.00438:#.4g}'` yeilds the string `'0.004380'`. Here the float
`0.00438` has been formatted according to the format specification
string `'#.4g'`. The rules for constructing format specification strings
are specified in [the format specification mini lanuage](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language) (FSML)
documentation.

The built-in FSML has a few short-comings making it non-ideal for all
scientific formatting tasks:
- The built-in FSML lacks certain features around rounding and
presenting floats based on significant figures (as opposed to precision)
which makes it challenging to apply certain formatting strategies.
  - It is possible to specify sig figs for formatting using the `e` and 
  `g`built in formatting modes, but it is impossible to format numbers 
  according to a specific number of sig figs while also presenting the 
  numbers in fixed point format. Specifically, it is impossible to 
  coerce the string formatting to perform rounding "above the decimal 
  point". There is no way to format `123` to yield `'120'`. You can use 
  `f'{123:#.4g}'` to get `'123.0'` (4 sig figs), but if you do 
  `f'{123:#.2g}'` you get `'1.2e+02'`. This is because built-in float 
  formatting does not allow formatting to perform rounding/truncation 
  *above* the decimal point.
  - The `#` option is necessary to format to a specified number of sig 
  figs in `g` mode (which must be used if you want any possibility of 
  fixed-point sig fig formatting) but, this option means mantissa with 
  no fractional part will include a trailing decimal point, e.g. 
  `f'{123:#.3g}'` gives `123.` which may be undesirable.
- While built-in formatting does provide a means to fill a string to a 
certain overall width (including all non-numeric symbols), it does not
provide a means to fill a string up to a certain digit place, e.g. add 
zeros up to the hundreds place which may sometimes be desirable.
- In the sciences it is very common to display numbers in *engineering* 
notation in which the exponent is chosen so that it is an integer
multiple of 3 and the mantissa is between `0.1 <= m < 1000`. Built-in 
formatting has no functionality for this feature. See 
[NIST Guide to the SI 7.9](https://www.nist.gov/pml/special-publication-811/nist-guide-si-chapter-7-rules-and-style-conventions-expressing-values)
for more details.
- The built-in formatting has limited functionality for customizing the 
separation and decimal characters used to display numbers.

While these shortcomings are all minor, and can be worked around with 
simple helper functions, it would be most convenient if scientific float
formatting could be easily accessed in-line during string formatting
operations.
This motivated the development of the `sciform` FSML.

# `sciform` Format Specification Mini Language

sciform introduces a new FSML based on the built-in FSML but which 
avoids the shortcomings described above and includes a few additional 
features. 
These features include:
- Flexible significant figure formatting
- Engineering notation
- Binary (base-2) exponent formatting
- Flexible separator selection
- Explicit exponent value specification

The `sciform` FSML is based on the built-in FSML, but it is not fully 
backwards compatible with it. 
For the sake of simplicity, some format 
specifications that are valid for the built-in FSML are invalid for the
`sciform` FSML. 
Also, a valid built-in format specification may give different results 
when used as part of the built-in FSML compared to when used as part of
the `sciform` FSML.
These incompatibilities are captured in a section below.

The `sciform` format specification mini language is given by:
```
[fill "="][sign]["#"][fill_top_digit]
[thousands_separator][decimal_separator][thousandths_separator]
[prec_mode precision][format_mode][exp][prefix_mode]
```
Where the terms are described in the table below.

The `sciform` FSML is accessed via the `sfloat` object. Regular built-in
floats are cast to `sfloat` objects which can be formatted using the 
`sciform` FSML.

```
from sciform import sfloat

num = sfloat(123456)
print(f'{num:_!2f}')
# 120_000
```

# Prefix Mode

Prefix mode offers a simple translation between exponent strings and 
one or two letter prefixes. 
For scientific and engineering formats the prefixes are matched to
integer multiple of 3 exponent according to the [SI prefixes](https://www.nist.gov/pml/owm/metric-si-prefixes).
For binary formatsthe prefixes are matched to integer multiples of 10 
according to the [IEC prefixes](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html).

Examples of prefix mode are:

- `f'{sfloat(12.4e+06):rp}'` gives `'12 M`'
- `f'{sfloat(1024*2**10):bp'` gives `1 Mi`


# Configuration options (forthcoming)

Forthcoming features to improve ease of configuration:
- Function-based (as opposed to string formatting/`__format__` based) 
  formatting.
- Ability to set module or class level defaults for each FSML term to 
  avoid repetitive, verbose format specifications.
- Class-based API for storing default configurations?
- Optional registration of new prefixes, notably `c`, `d`, `da`, and `h` which 
  are recognized SI prefixes for 10<sup>-2</sup>, 10<sup>-1</sup>, 
  10<sup>+1</sup> and 10<sup>+2</sup> respectively.


# Value + uncertainty formatting (forthcoming)

One of (if not the) most important use cases for scientific formatting
is formatting a value together with its specified uncertainty, e.g.
`84.3 +/- 0.2`. The ability to format pairs of floats as 
value/uncertainty pairs will be supported by the forthcoming `ufloat`
class.

Value/uncertainty formatting is not yet fully implemented or tested, but 
it will support
- Selection of the exponent based on the value
- Selection of the least significant digit based on a user-requested
  number of sig figs to display for the uncertainty.
- Optional padding so that the value and uncertainty have the same 
  width
- Short form "parentheses" uncertainty display, e.g. 
  `84.3 +/- 2= 84.3(2)`.


# Incompatibilities With Built-in Format Specification Mini Language

The `sciform` FSML extends the functionality of the built-in FSML. 
However, `sciform` FSML is not entirely backwards compatible with the
built-in FSML. 
Certain allowed built-in format specifications are
illegal in `sciform` FSML and certain allowed built-in format 
specifications give different results when used with `sfloat` rather 
than `float.`. 
These incompatibilities were intentionally introduced to simplify the 
`sciform` FSML by cutting out features less likely to be required for
scientific formatting.

- The built-in FSML accepts `g`, `G` and `n` precision types
  These precision types are not supported by scientific formatting.
  These precision types offer automated formatting decisions which are
  not compatible with the explicit formatting options preferred by
  `sciform`. These features include
    - Automated selection of fixed-point or scientific notation. For
      `sciform`, the user must explicity indicate
      fixed point, scientific, or engineering notation by selecting one
      of the `f`, `F`, `e`, `E`, `r` or `R` flags.
    - Truncation of trailing zeros without the `#` option. For
      `sciform`, trailing zeros are never truncated if they fall within 
      the user-selected precision or sig figs.
    - Inclusion of a hanging decimal point, e.g. `123.`. `sciform` 
      never includes a hanging decimal point.
- Python float formatting uses a pre-selected, hard-coded precion of 6 
  for `f`, `F`, `%`, `e`, and `E` modes. 
  When no precision or sig fig specification is provided, `sciform`, 
  instead, infers the precision or sig fig specification from the float 
  by determining the least significant decimal digit required to 
  represent it. 
  Note that there may be surprising results for floats that require more 
  decimals to represent than `sys.float_info.dig` such as `0.1 * 3`.
  - `f'{float(0.3):f}'` yield `0.300000` while `f'{sfloat(0.3):f}` yields `0.3`.
- The built-in FSML supports left-aligned, right-aligned, 
  center-aligned, and sign-aware string padding by any character. 
  In the built-in FSML, the width field indicates the length to which 
  the resulting string (including all punctuation such as `+`, `-`, `.`, 
  `e`, etc.) should be filled to. 
  `sciform` takes the perspective that these padding features are mostly 
  tasks for string formatters, not number formatters. 
  `sciform` only supports padding by a space `' '` or zero. 
  For `sciform`, the user specifies the digits place to which the number
  should be padded. 
  For `sciform`, the fill character may only be `' '` or `'0'` and must 
  always be followed by the sign aware `=` flag. 
  There is no `0` flag that may be placed before the width field to 
  indicate sign-aware zero padding.
  - `f'{float(12): =4}` yields `'  12'` while `f{sfloat(12): =4}` yeilds 
    `'   12'`. I.e. fill characters are padded up to the `10^4` digits 
    place.
- The built-in FSML supports displaying negative zero, but also supports
  an option to coerce negative zero to be positive by including a `'z'`
  flag.
  `sciform` always coerces negative zero to be positive and therefore 
  has no corresponding option to coerce negative zero to be positive.
