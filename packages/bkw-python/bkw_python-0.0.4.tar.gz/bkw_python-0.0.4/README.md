BankruptcyWatch provides a single source to automate any bankruptcy workflow. The BankruptcyWatch PACER API is hands down the most powerful and comprehensive tool available for interacting with bankruptcy data and researching case information. We provide a collection of services that make interacting with the United States Bankruptcy Courts faster, less expensive, and more reliable.

This Python client is a very limited library to interact with the BankruptcyWatch API. Feel free to help expand the coverage of this library by submitting pull requests.

## Getting Started
You will need a BankruptcyWatch account to use the BankruptcyWatch API. If you do not have one, you can sign up at https://www.bankruptcywatch.com/.
