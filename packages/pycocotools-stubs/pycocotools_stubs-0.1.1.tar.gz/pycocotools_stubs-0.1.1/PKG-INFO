Unofficial python stubs for the [pycocotools package](https://pypi.org/project/pycocotools/).

An equivalents stubs is available on [typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pycocotools).
This stubs are different on two points:
- They include the docstrings as they are otherwise not available in the IDE (as far as I know).
- They include numpy typing (not possible to do in typeshed).

## Installation

The package is available on pypi [here](https://pypi.org/project/pycocotools-stubs/), you can install it with:

```
pip install pycocotools-stubs
```
