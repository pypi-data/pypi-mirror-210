RaGraph
#######

RaGraph is a package to create, manipulate, and analyze graphs consisting of nodes and
edges. Nodes usually represent (hierarchies of) objects and edges the dependencies or
relationships between them.

These graphs, or networks if you will, lend themselves well to applied analyses like
clustering and sequencing, as well as analyses involving the calculation of various
insightful metrics.


**********
Quickstart
**********

Installation
============

RaGraph can be installed using ``pip install ragraph[all]`` for any Python version >=3.9. Or,
for Poetry managed projects, use ``poetry add ragraph -E all`` to add it as a dependency.


Using RaGraph
=============

RaGraph's primary use is working with Graph objects that contain Nodes and Eges between
Nodes. See the `usage documentation <https://ragraph.ratio-case.nl/usage/index.html>`_
for more info!
