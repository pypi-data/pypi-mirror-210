description = "To improve EDU segmentation performance using Segbot. As Segbot has an encoder-decoder model architecture, we can replace bidirectional GRU encoder with generative pretraining models such as BART and T5. Evaluate the new model using the RST dataset by using few-shot based settings (e.g. 100 examples) to train the model, instead of using the full dataset."
