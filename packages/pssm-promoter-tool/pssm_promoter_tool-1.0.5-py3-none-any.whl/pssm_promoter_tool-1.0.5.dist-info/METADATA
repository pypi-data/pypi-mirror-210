**PSSM Promoter Tool**

The tool applies CORPSE (Codon Restrained Promoter Silencing) method and inverted CORPSE (iCORPSE) to the provided gene sequence.

-35 and -10 promoters along with the additional non-canonical sequence motifs are predicted based on the Salis Lab Promoter Calculator (https://github.com/hsalis/SalisLabCode/tree/master/Promoter_Calculator).
Position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is applied to all the synonymous codon variants of the promoters associated with the lowest and highest transcription rates in order to maximally decrease (CORPSE) or increase the transcription rate (iCORPSE).
The output CSV file/files contain synonymous codon promoters and sequence motifs for the minimal and maximal transcriptional rates along with the non-canonical sequence motifs for forward and reverse strands.

INSTALLATION:

1. Install required libraries using pip:
```
pip install pssm-promoter-tool
```

2. Download and unpack the archive with files using "Code"->"Download ZIP" buttons in the right corner at https://github.com/ellinium/pssm_promoter_tool. 
Or use
```
git clone https://github.com/ellinium/pssm-promoter-tool
```
[! you need to have a Git account and be authorised in the system to run the command !]


USAGE:

The tool requires a text or fasta file with a nucleotide sequence of a gene to process.
From the folder with the downloaded files run:
```
python pssm_promoter_calculator.py <file_name>
```
where 'file_name' is a path to the file with a gene sequence (TXT or FASTA format).

Depending on the result, up to four output CSV files can be generated:
1) PSSMPromoterCalculator_MIN_FWD_results.csv - contains promoters to minimise transcription rate (forward strand)
2) PSSMPromoterCalculator_MIN_REV_results.csv - contains promoters to minimise transcription rate (reverse strand)
3) PSSMPromoterCalculator_MAX_FWD_results.csv - contains promoters to maximise transcription rate (forward strand)
4) PSSMPromoterCalculator_MAX_REV_results.csv - contains promoters to maximise transcription rate (reverse strand).

The output file fields in the CSV files contain data from Salis' Promoter calculator and additional fields:
1) Type - 'Original Promoter' - for original sequence promoters; 'Modified Promoter' - for synonymous promoters. 
2) TSS -  transcriptional start site 
3) Tx_rate - transcription initiation rate 
4) Tx_rate_FoldChange - the fold change between the original transcription rate and re-calculated with PSSM primers 
5) hex35 -  an upstream 6-nucleotide site called the −35 motif 
6) PSSM_hex35 - position-specific scoring matrix value for the -35 motif 
7) AA_hex35 - an amino acid sequence for the -35 motif 
8) hex10 - a downstream 6-nucleotide site called the −10 motif 
9) PSSM_hex10 - position-specific scoring matrix value for the -10 motif 
10) AA_hex10 - an amino acid sequence for the -10 motif 
11) UP - a 20-nucleotide region that appears upstream of the −35 motif, called the UP element 
12) spacer - a spacer region that separates the −10 and −35 motifs 
13) disc - a typically 6-nucleotide region in between the −10 motif and TSS, called the discriminator (Disc)
14) ITR - the first 20 transcribed nucleotides, called the initial transcribed region (ITR)
15) new_gene_sequence - contains a gene sequence (nt) with substituted (Type = 'Modified Promoter') or  original promoters (Type = 'Original Promoter')
16) promoter_sequence - contains -35 motif, spacer and - 10 motif 
17) dG_total - total Gibbs free energy for the sequence 
18) dG_10 - -10 motif Gibbs free energy 
19) dG_35 - -35 motif Gibbs free energy 
20) dG_disc - a discriminator Gibbs free energy 
21) dG_ITR - an ITR Gibbs free energy 
22) dG_ext10 −10 extended motif Gibbs free energy 
23) dG_spacer - a spacer Gibbs free energy 
24) dG_UP - an UP Gibbs free energy 
25) dG_bind - binding Gibbs free energy 
26) UP_position - a position of the UP element 
27) hex35_position - a position of the -35 motif 
28) spacer_position - a position of the spacer 
29) hex10_position - a position of the -10 motif 
30) disc_position - a position of the discriminator
