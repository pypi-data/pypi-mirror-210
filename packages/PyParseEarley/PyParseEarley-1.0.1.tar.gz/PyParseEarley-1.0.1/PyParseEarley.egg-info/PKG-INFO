# YAEP (Yet Another Earley Parser)

YAEP (Yet Another Earley Parser) is a high-performance package parsing syntax trees from Context-Free Grammars (CFGs). It implements the efficient Earley parsing algorithm, supporting ambiguity and generating comprehensive syntax trees. Designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, YAEP bridges theory and practice, providing computational linguists with a reliable tool for linguistic research and NLP applications.

## Features
- Efficient parsing of CFGs
- Support for ambiguous and non-deterministic grammar
- Generation of comprehensive syntax trees
- Designed for NLP tasks and applications

## Install dependency
```bash
pip install CairoSVG pydot
```

## Getting Started
1. Define your CFG grammar in json format.
2. Utilize the YAEP API to parse sentences and generate syntax trees.

## Examples
```python
import YAEP
from YAEP import earley
from YAEP import utils

grammar = {
    'S': [['VP'], ['NP']],
    'VP': [['Verb']],
    'NP': [['Det', 'Nominal'], ['Proper-Noun'], ['Noun']],
    'Nominal': [['Noun'], ['Noun', 'Nominal']],
    'Det': [['that'], ['this'], ['a']],
    'Proper-Noun': [['Batman']],
    'Noun': [['book'], ['flight'], ['banana'], ['meal'], ['factory']],
    'Verb': [['book']],
}

words = "This book".split()
chart = earley.Earley().earley_parse(words, grammar)
parsed = [s for s in chart[-1] if s.left == 'S']

print(utils.tree_to_digraph(parsed[0],words))
```
