    r"""
    Full, directive syntax for chart widgets.

    The label text may be passed as the one optional argument.
    This may be omitted only if the label text is instead passed via
    the 'alt' option. Note that, if we are defined under an rST substitution,
    (see https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#substitution-definitions)
    then the 'alt' option will be automatically set equal to the inner text of
    the substitution.

    Special rule: if the label text is passed via 'alt' option,
    then, if it begins with a substring matching the regex r'[a-z]+\d+:\s*',
    then this prefix is omitted from the label text.

    Example: In

        Let's open the |w001: proof|.

        .. |w001: proof| pfsc-chart::
            :view: Pf
            :color:
                bgB: Pf.A03

    the label text will be "proof". This allows adding an enumeration (w001 etc.)
    to the substitution text for the sake of unique matching, without messing
    up the label.

    The intention is to support the same options that are supported by chart
    widgets in the classic annotation syntax; however,
        * At this time, support is incomplete.
        * The syntax is somewhat different.
    See below.

    Current support
    ===============

    * Each of the `on_board`, `off_board`, `view`, and `select` fields
      can receive only a boxlisting. This means:
        - None of these fields can yet receive any keywords (e.g. "all" for `off_board`).
        - The `view` option cannot yet receive its more advanced format, where
          a whole dictionary is passed.
    * The `color` and `hovercolor` fields are fully supported.

    Syntax
    ======

    Generally, the goal is to take advantage of the possibilities of rST, to make
    a nicer, easier syntax than is available in annotations. In the latter, we
    are constrained by JSON format; here we are not.

    Boxlistings
    -----------

    There is no need for surrounding brackets to make a list, or
    for quotation marks to make a string. Thus, for example, you may write

        :view: Thm.A10, Pf.{A10,A20}

    which is equivalent to `view: ["Thm.A10", "Pf.{A10,A20}"]` in the old,
    annotation syntax.

    Color / Hovercolor
    ------------------

    In the old annotation syntax, this is defined by a dictionary
    of key-value pairs. Because keys must be unique there, we allowed the keys
    to be either color codes, or multipaths.

    Here, you should instead give a listing of `colorCodes: boxlisting` pairs,
    one per line.

    Because there is no unique-key constraint, there is no reason to allow
    multipaths on the left. (For annotations, we decided you might want to be
    able to use the same color spec twice, without having to make a giant RHS,
    so we allowed the option of putting the libpaths on the LHS.)
    Therefore color codes should always be on the left, boxlistings on the right.

    Since multipaths are no longer allowed on the left, there is no longer a
    need to disambiguate between color codes and libpaths, and therefore color
    codes no longer need to be preceded by colons. On the contrary, in rST we
    don't want color codes to begin and end with colons, since this would be
    recognized by syntax highlighters as being a part of rST.

    Therefore color codes should simply be separated by commas.

    As in the old annotation syntax, we support the special `update` color code,
    which applies to the whole directive, and therefore does not need any
    righthand side.

    Example:

        update
        push,bgR,olY,fi0,diGB: libpath.to.node1

    which means:

        Do not clear existing colors; simply add the given settings.
        For node1:
            - push current colors onto node1's color stack
            - set background red
            - set outline yellow
            - clear any existing colors from incoming flow edges
            - give incoming deduction edges a gradient from green to blue

    Note that `update` is meaningless in hovercolor, which is always done as
    an update.

    See the docstring for the ColorManager class in pfsc-moose for more info.
