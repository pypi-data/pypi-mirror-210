sphinx-proofscape
=================

Sphinx extension for use with Proofscape.

In versions ``0.3.x``, this package provided both syntax highlighting (for the
Proofscape module language and Meson language), and roles and directives for
chart widgets.

In versions ``0.4.x``, only syntax highlighting is provided. Development of
widget roles and directives has moved to the ``pise/server`` project.
