Joint Disfluency Detection and Constituency Parsing
------------------------------------------------------------
A joint disfluency detection and constituency parsing model for transcribed speech based on [Neural Constituency Parsing of Speech Transcripts](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1282) from NAACL 2019, with additional changes (e.g. self-training and ensembling) as described in [Improving Disfluency Detection by Self-Training a Self-Attentive Model](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.346/) from ACL 2020.

This repository updated the original repository to focus on inferencing using the pretrained [`swbd_fisher_bert_Edev.0.9078.pt`](https://github.com/pariajm/joint-disfluency-detector-and-parser/releases/download/naacl2019/swbd_fisher_bert_Edev.0.9078.pt) model.

### Installation
```bash
$ pip install disfluency-constituency-parser
```

### Usage
```bash
$ wget https://github.com/pariajm/joint-disfluency-detector-and-parser/releases/download/naacl2019/swbd_fisher_bert_Edev.0.9078.pt
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-uncased-vocab.txt
$ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/bert-base-uncased.tar.gz
```


```python
from dc_parser import DC_Model
model = DC_Model(model_path = "/path/to/swbd_fisher_bert_Edev.0.9078.pt",
                bert_model_path = "/path/to/bert-base-uncased.tar.gz",
                bert_vocab_path = "/path/to/bert-base-uncased-vocab.txt",)
model.parse(["Today is a very good day!"])
```
