# EIA

The client exposes a simple interface to the EIA API.

Huge thanks to the EIA for providing this API
See https://www.eia.gov/opendata/documentation.php for detailed API documentation

## Installation

```bash
pip install eia
```

## Examples

Get information on the available "petroleum" datasets.

```python
client.dataset_info("petroleum")
```

Get information on operational and power data, including generation.
```python
# Series Info includes data series with specific data elements and facets
operational = client.series_info("electricity/electric-power-operational-data")
operational.data
```

See examples in the [example](example/example.ipynb) directory.

Note: the client does not manage rate limits. See the [EIA API documentation](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/documentation.php) for more information on rate limits.
