=========

0.5.3 - 2023-05-24
------------------

Fixed
~~~~~

-  ``test_requirements.txt`` now lists pytest instead of nose.

.. _section-1:

0.5.2 - 2023-05-18
------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Updated to support PySpark 3.3.0.

.. _section-2:

0.5.1 - 2022-11-16
------------------

.. _changed-1:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Updated to Tumult Core 0.6.0.

.. _section-3:

0.5.0 - 2022-10-17
------------------

Added
~~~~~

-  Added a diagram to the API reference page.
-  Analytics now does an additional Spark configuration check for users running Java 11+ at the time of Analytics Session initialization. If the user is running Java 11 or higher with an incorrect Spark configuration, Analytics raises an informative exception.
-  Added a method to check that basic Analytics functionality works (``tmlt.analytics.utils.check_installation``).

.. _changed-2:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Changed argument names for ``QueryBuilder.count_distinct`` and ``KeySet.__getitem__`` from ``cols`` to ``columns``, for consistency. The old argument has been deprecated, but is still available.
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Changed the argument name for ``Session.partition_and_create`` from ``attr_name`` to ``column``. The old argument has been deprecated, but is still available.
-  Improved the error message shown when a filter expression is invalid.
-  Updated to Tumult Core 0.5.0.
   As a result, ``python-flint`` is no longer a transitive dependency, simplifying the Analytics installation process.

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

-  The contents of the ``cleanup`` module have been moved to the ``utils`` module. The ``cleanup`` module will be removed in a future version.

.. _section-4:

0.4.2 - 2022-09-06
------------------

.. _fixed-1:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Switched to Core version 0.4.3 to avoid warnings when evaluating some queries.

.. _section-5:

0.4.1 - 2022-08-25
------------------

.. _added-1:

Added
~~~~~

-  Added ``QueryBuilder.histogram`` function, which provides a shorthand for generating binned data counts.
-  Analytics now checks to see if the user is running Java 11 or higher. If they are, Analytics either sets the appropriate Spark options (if Spark is not yet running) or raises an informative exception (if Spark is running and configured incorrectly).

.. _changed-3:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Improved documentation for ``QueryBuilder.map`` and ``QueryBuilder.flat_map``.

.. _fixed-2:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Switched to Core version 0.4.2, which contains a fix for an issue that sometimes caused queries to fail to be compiled.

.. _section-6:

0.4.0 - 2022-07-22
------------------

.. _added-2:

Added
~~~~~

-  ``Session.from_dataframe`` and ``Session.Builder.with_private_dataframe`` now have a ``grouping_column`` option and support non-integer stabilities.
   This allows setting up grouping columns like those that result from grouping flatmaps when loading data.
   This is an advanced feature, and should be used carefully.

.. _section-7:

0.3.0 - 2022-06-23
------------------

.. _added-3:

Added
~~~~~

-  Added ``QueryBuilder.bin_column`` and an associated ``BinningSpec`` type.
-  Dates may now be used in ``KeySet``\ s.
-  Added support for DataFrames containing NaN and null values. Columns created by Map and FlatMap are now marked as potentially containing NaN and null values.
-  Added ``QueryBuilder.replace_null_and_nan`` function, which replaces null and NaN values with specified defaults.
-  Added ``QueryBuilder.replace_infinite`` function, which replaces positive and negative infinity values with specified defaults.
-  Added ``QueryBuilder.drop_null_and_nan`` function, which drops null and NaN values for specified columns.
-  Added ``QueryBuilder.drop_infinite`` function, which drops infinite values for specified columns.
-  Aggregations (sum, quantile, average, variance, and standard deviation) now silently drop null and NaN values before being performed.
-  Aggregations (sum, quantile, average, variance, and standard deviation) now silently clamp infinite values (+infinity and -infinity) to the query’s lower and upper bounds.
-  Added a ``cleanup`` module with two functions: a ``cleanup`` function to remove the current temporary table (which should be called before ``spark.stop()``), and a ``remove_all_temp_tables`` function that removes all temporary tables ever created by Analytics.
-  Added a topic guide in the documentation for Tumult Analytics’ treatment of null, NaN, and infinite values.

.. _changed-4:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Sessions no longer allow DataFrames to contain a column named ``""`` (the empty string).
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: You can no longer call ``Session.Builder.with_privacy_budget`` multiple times on the same builder.
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: You can no longer call ``Session.add_private_data`` multiple times with the same source id.
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Sessions now use the DataFrame’s schema to determine which columns are nullable.

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Removed ``groupby_public_source`` and ``groupby_domains`` from ``QueryBuilder``.
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: ``Session.from_csv`` and CSV-related methods on ``Session.Builder`` have been removed.
   Instead, use ``spark.read.csv`` along with ``Session.from_dataframe`` and other dataframe-based methods.
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Removed ``validate`` option from ``Session.from_dataframe``, ``Session.add_public_dataframe``, ``Session.Builder.with_private_dataframe``, ``Session.Builder.with_public_dataframe``.
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Removed ``KeySet.contains_nan_or_null``.

.. _fixed-3:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  *Backwards-incompatible*: ``KeySet``\ s now explicitly check for and disallow the use of floats and timestamps as keys.
   This has always been the intended behavior, but it was previously not checked for and could work or cause non-obvious errors depending on the situation.
-  ``KeySet.dataframe()`` now always returns a dataframe where all rows are distinct.
-  Under certain circumstances, evaluating a ``GroupByCountDistinct`` query expression used to modify the input ``QueryExpr``.
   This no longer occurs.
-  It is now possible to partition on a column created by a grouping flat map, which used to raise exception from Core.

0.2.1 - 2022-04-14 (internal release)
-------------------------------------

.. _added-4:

Added
~~~~~

-  Added support for basic operations (filter, map, etc.) on Spark date and timestamp columns.
   ``ColumnType`` has two new variants, ``DATE`` and ``TIMESTAMP``, to support these.
-  Future documentation will now include any exceptions defined in Analytics.

.. _changed-5:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  Switch session to use Persist/Unpersist instead of Cache.

.. _internal-release-1:

0.2.0 - 2022-03-28 (internal release)
-------------------------------------

.. _removed-1:

Removed
~~~~~~~

-  Multi-query evaluate support is entirely removed.
-  Columns that are neither floats nor doubles will no longer be checked for NaN values.
-  The ``BIT`` variant of the ``ColumnType`` enum was removed, as it was not supported elsewhere in Analytics.

.. _changed-6:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  *Backwards-incompatible*: Renamed ``query_exprs`` parameter in ``Session.evaluate`` to ``query_expr``.
-  *Backwards-incompatible*: ``QueryBuilder.join_public`` and the ``JoinPublic`` query expression can now accept public tables specified as Spark dataframes. The existing behavior using public source IDs is still supported, but the ``public_id`` parameter/property is now called ``public_table``.
-  Installation on Python 3.7.1 through 3.7.3 is now allowed.
-  KeySets now do type coercion on creation, matching the type coercion that Sessions do for private sources.
-  Sessions created by ``partition_and_create`` must be used in the order they were created, and using the parent session will forcibly close all child sessions.
   Sessions can be manually closed with ``session.stop()``.

.. _fixed-4:

Fixed
~~~~~

-  Joining with a public table that contains no NaNs, but has a column where NaNs are allowed, previously caused an error when compiling queries. This is now handled correctly.

.. _internal-release-2:

0.1.1 - 2022-02-28 (internal release)
-------------------------------------

.. _added-5:

Added
~~~~~

-  Added a ``KeySet`` class, which will eventually be used for all GroupBy queries.
-  Added ``QueryBuilder.groupby()``, a new group-by based on ``KeySet``\ s.

.. _changed-7:

Changed
~~~~~~~

-  The Analytics library now uses ``KeySet`` and ``QueryBuilder.groupby()`` for all
   GroupBy queries.
-  The various ``Session`` methods for loading in data from CSV no longer support loading the data’s schema from a file.
-  Made Session return a more user-friendly error message when the user provides a privacy budget of 0.
-  Removed all instances of the old name of this library, and replaced them with “Analytics”

.. _deprecated-1:

Deprecated
~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``QueryBuilder.groupby_domains()`` and ``QueryBuilder.groupby_public_source()`` are now deprecated in favor of using ``QueryBuilder.groupby()`` with ``KeySet``\ s.
   They will be removed in a future version.

.. _internal-release-3:

0.1.0 - 2022-02-15 (internal release)
-------------------------------------

.. _added-6:

Added
~~~~~

-  Initial release.
