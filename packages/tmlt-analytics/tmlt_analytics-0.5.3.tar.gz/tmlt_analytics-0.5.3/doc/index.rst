Tumult Analytics is a Python library for computing aggregate queries on tabular
data using differential privacy.

Tumult Analytics is…

- … *robust*: it is built and maintained by a team of differential privacy
  experts, and runs in production at institutions like the U.S. Census Bureau.
- … *scalable*: it runs on `Spark <http://spark.apache.org>`__, so it can scale
  to very large datasets.
- … *easy to use*: its interface will seem familiar to anyone with prior
  experience with tools like SQL or
  `PySpark <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/>`__.
- … *feature-rich*: it supports a large and ever-growing list of aggregation
  functions, data transformation operators, and privacy definitions.
