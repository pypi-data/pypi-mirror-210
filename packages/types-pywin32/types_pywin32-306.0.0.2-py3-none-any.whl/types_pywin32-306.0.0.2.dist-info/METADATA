## Typing stubs for pywin32

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `pywin32` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`pywin32`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pywin32. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `d6a85e2c4820a69e504cdea1b446f3764cc3afec`.
