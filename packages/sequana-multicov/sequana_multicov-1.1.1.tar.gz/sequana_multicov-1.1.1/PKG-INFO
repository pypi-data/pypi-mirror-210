        :Overview: Parallelised version of sequana_coverage for large eukaryotes genome.
        :Input: A set of BAM or BED files. BED file must have 3 or 4 columns. First column is
            the chromosome/contig name, second column stored positions and third the
            coverage. Fourth optional columns contains a filtered coverage (not used in
            the analysis but shown in the HTML reports)
        :Output: a set of HTML reports for each chromosomes and a multiqc report
        :Status: production

        Installation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        
        sequana_multicov is based on Python3, just install the package as follows::
        
            pip install sequana_multicov --upgrade
        
        
        Usage
        ~~~~~
        
        ::
        
            sequana_multicov --help
            sequana_multicov --input-directory DATAPATH 
        
        By default, this looks for BED file. WARNING. This are BED3 meaning a 3-columns
        tabulated file like this one::
        
            chr1 1 10
            chr1 2 11
            ...
            chr1 N1 10
            chr2 1 20
            chr2 2 21
            ...
            chr2 N2 20
        
        where the first column stored the chromosome name, the second is the position
        and the third is the coverage itself. See sequana_coverage documentation for
        details. If you have BAM files as input, we will do the conversion for you. In
        such case, use this option::
        
            --input-pattern "*.bam"
        
        The sequana_coverage script creates a directory with the pipeline and 
        its configuration file. You will then need 
        to execute the pipeline::
        
            cd coverage
            sh coverage.sh  # for a local run
        
        This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can 
        retrieve the pipeline itself and its configuration files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::
        
            snakemake -s multicov.rules -c config.yaml --cores 4 --stats stats.txt
        
        Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html>`_ interface as follows::
        
            sequanix -w analysis -i . -p coverage
        
        Go to the second panel, in Input data and then in Input directory. There, you
        must modify the pattern (empty field by default meaning search for fastq files)
        and set the field to either::
        
            *.bed
        
        or::
        
            *.bam
        
        
        You are ready to go. Save the project and press Run. Once done, open the HTML report.
        
        
        Requirements
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This pipelines requires the following executable(s):
        
        - sequana_coverage from **Sequana**, which should be installed automatically.
        - multiqc
        
        .. .. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/multicov/master/sequana_pipelines/multicov/dag.png
        
        
        Details
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        This pipeline runs **coverage** in parallel on the input BAM files (or BED file). 
        
        
        The coverage tool takes as input a BAM or a BED file. The BED file must have 3
        or 4 columns as explained in the standalone application (sequana_coverage) 
        `documentation <http://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/applications.html?highlight=coverage#sequana-coverage>`_. 
        In short, the first column is the chromosome name, the second column is the
        position (sorted) and the third column is the coverage (an optional fourth
        column would contain a coverage signal, which could be high quality coverage for
        instance).
        
        If you have only BAM files, you can convert them using **bioconvert** tool or
        the command::
        
            samtools depth -aa input.bam > output.bed
        
        If you have a CRAM file::
        
            samtools view -@ 4 -T reference.fa -b -o out.bam  in.cram
        
        For very large BAM/BED files, we recommend to split the BED file by
        chromosomes. For instance for the chromosome  chr1, type::
        
            # samtools index in.bam
            samtools depth -aa input.bam -r chr1 in.bam > chr1.bed
        
        The standalone or Snakemake application can also take as input your BAM file and
        will convert it automatically into a BED file.
        
        
        Rules and configuration details
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Here is the `latest documented configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/multicov/main/sequana_pipelines/multicov/config.yaml>`_
        to be used with the pipeline. Each rule used in the pipeline may have a section in the configuration file.
