# Eases in and out of keyframes.
# This was the very first easing transition I implemented,
# but I now almost always use quadease instead, as I think
# it looks better and is probably faster to compute.
# Qualitatively, the main difference between atanease and
# quadease is that atanease is slower at the start and end,
# and faster in the middle compared to quadease.

# Glide transition maker.
# Returns a glide transition based on the inflection points
# provided.
# A glide transition is where an animation accelerates in,
# moves at a constant speed for a while, then decelerates out.
# The points at which one behavior switches to the next are
# called inflection points.
# The acceleration and deceleration follow a quadratic
# trajectory.
#
# INPUTS (positional only)
# a = First inflection: a number in the range [0,1].
#     For example: a = 0.25 means acceleration phase will
#     last until 25% of the transition is completed.
# b = Second inflection. If unspecified, defaults to 1-a
#     to make a symmetric glide. Must satisfy a <= b.
#
# Example usage:
#   myfig.transition = morpho.transition.glide(0.2)
#   myfig2.transition = morpho.transition.glide(0.1, 0.75)
#
# If a = b = 0, the transition will be identical to toss.
# If a = b = 0.5, the transition will be identical to quadease.
# If a = b = 1, the transition will be identical to drop.
