# PlexPreferNonForcedSubs

## Short Description
This Python script sets all movies and shows in your local Plex library to English non-forced subtitles by default. It designed to work on Python 3.5 or later and compatible on any operating system where Python is installed (Windows, macOS, Linux, etc).

## Long Description
This script utilizes the Plex Python API and sets all movies and shows in your local Plex library to English non-forced subtitles by default. The subtitle preferences will be applied to your Plex profile and remembered on other devices. By default, Plex prefers forced subtitles when available for a given item. However, Plex does not natively allow you to prefer non-forced subtitles, which is why this script was created.

The script has been thoroughly tested and confirmed to be working. Feel free to use the code for your own purposes. I will be running this code periodically on my home server along with some other Plex scripts, such as [Plex Auto Delete](https://github.com/Casvt/Plex-scripts/blob/main/changing_settings/plex_auto_delete.py). Special thanks to everyone who provided assistance! If you encounter any bugs while using this script, please open an issue. Cheers!
