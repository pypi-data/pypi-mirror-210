This gives you the advantages of bash when working with other\nprocesses while also giving you the advantages of a modern language like Python.\n\nIt's a free software distributed under the MIT Licence unless\notherwise specified.\n\nDevelopment is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/jfcarter2358/calligraphy/\n\nPull requests are amazing and most welcome.\n\n## Install\n\nCalligraphy can be simply installed by running\n\n```\npip install calligraphy-scripting\n```\n\nIf you want to install from a source distribution, extract the tarball and run\nthe following command (this requires poetry to be installed)\n\n```\npoetry install --no-dev\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation lives at https://calligraphy.readthedocs.io/.\n\n## Testing\n\nWe use `pytest` and `pytest-cov` for running the test suite. You should be able to install them with\n\n```\npip install pytest pytest-cov\n```\n\nor you can install calligraphy alongside those packages with\n\n```\npoetry install\n```\n\nTo run the test suite, you can do\n\n```\nmake test\n```\n\nThis will produce an html coverage report under the `htmlcov` directory.\n\n## Roadmap\n\nYou can find the Calligraphy roadmap [here](https://jfcarter2358.notion.site/5081d4214297401db15a43e47a974521?v=9858c59c7ecd4eefa09bf75158c47448)\n\n## License\n\nCalligraphy is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns please reach out to me (John Carter) at [jfcarter2358@gmail.com](mailto:jfcarter2358@gmail.com)\n",
