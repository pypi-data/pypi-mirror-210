        The custom distance function to be wrapped.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_size
        Size of the sliding window use to search neighbors with.
    min_distance_keep
        The minimum distance (similarity) to consider adding a point to the window.
        E.g., a value of 0.0 will add even exact duplicates.
    distance_func
        A distance function which accepts two input items to compare.

    Notes
    -----
    Updates are by default stored by the FIFO (first in first out) method,
    which means that when the size limit is reached, old samples are dumped to
    give room for new samples. This is circular, meaning that older points
    are dumped first. This also gives the implementation a temporal aspect,
    because older samples are replaced with newer ones.

    The parameter `min_dinstance_keep` controls the addition of new items to the
    window - items that are far enough away (> min_distance_keep) are added to
    the window. Thus a value of 0 indicates that we add all points, and
    increasing from 0 makes it less likely we will keep a new item.

            An extra set of metadata to add to the window that is not passed to
            the distance function, and allows easy customization without needing
            to always write a custom distance function.
