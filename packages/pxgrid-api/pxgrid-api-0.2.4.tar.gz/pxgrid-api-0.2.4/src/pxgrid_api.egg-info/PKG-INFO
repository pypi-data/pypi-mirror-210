           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

Introduction
============

This repo includes two components:
- A python API library making it easier to interact with pxGrid services on ISE
- Interactive CLI utility to interface with pxGrid without writing any code

pxGrid requires FQDNs of all the nodes to be resolvable. It is not possible to use the library or the CLI utility to connect to ISE via IP address, even if there's just one node. Hosts record will work as well.

Full API documention is available at https://pxgrid-api.readthedocs.io/

Features
--------

- Support for both certificate and password authentication when connecting to pxGrid nodes
- Commands and methods to interact with most pxGrid services
- Websocket support for subscribing to topics.
- Debug capabilities to show all low level interactions with pxGrid

Limitations
-----------

- pxGrid API 2.0 only. No support for 1.0
- Private key must be unencrypted
- No support for Dynamic Topics
- Websockets (subscribing to topics) require that the pxGrid node certificate is trusted

Additonal reference material

PXAPI Library
=============

This library simplifies interaction with ISE pxGrid


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

  # Install the module
  pip install pxgrid-api

Usage
-----

pxapi.py file has comments throughout describing all functions.  
All data is returned in the original form, converted to python dict

REST API
~~~~~~~~

These are fairly straight forward. Review the comments in the code for reference.

.. code-block:: python

  #!/usr/bin/env python3
  from pxapi import PXAPI

  # Instatiate object. Root CA argument can be omitted to disable server certificate verification.
  api=PXAPI('pxgridnode.example.com','client-name','client.cer','client.key','root.cer')

  # Check account activation status. This will connect to pxGrid node and check if our account is in approved and enabled state
  # With this default usage, the function will return immediately with either True or False on the state of the account
  api.account_activate()

  # Optionally, function can wait until the account is approved and retry every 60 seconds
  api.account_activate(True)

  # Some examples
  # Retrive all sessions
  print(api.get_sessions())

  # Retrieve all Trustsec egress policies
  print(api.trustsec_get_egress_policies())

  # Retrive all NON-Compliant MDM endpoints
  print(api.mdm_get_endpoints_by_type('NON-COMPLIANT'))

Password based authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This type of authentication avoids having to work with client side certificates and private keys.

In order to use password based authentication, it needs to be first enabled in ISE under Administration > pxGrid Services > Settings

The first step to use password authentication is to request a bootstrap account with a password generated by ISE.

.. code-block:: python

  # Instatiate API object with minimum information. Root CA argument can be omitted to disable server certificate verification.
  api=PXAPI('pxgridnode.example.com','pwdclient1','','','root.cer')

  # Next, create the account. The account will be created with the username specified as client name above.
  # The password returned by ISE has to be stored on the client side.
  # The account will show in Initialized state on ISE
  # This API call can be executed multiple times with the same name to generate a new password until the account is activated below
  account_info=api.account_create()
  print(account_info)
  {'nodeName': 'pwdclient1', 'password': 'doosV8AEKqL7URUE', 'userName': 'pwdclient1'}
  password=accountInfo['password']

  # We now need to initialize API again with the password this time
  api=PXAPI('pxgridnode.example.com','pwdclient1','','','root.cer',password)

  # To request this account to be approved, we need to execute accountActivate API call.
  # Note that once this account is requested to be activated, you can no longer call accountCreate API above with the same client name
  # Once the account is in Pending state, it has to be approved in ISE under Administration > pxGrid Services > Client Management
  account_status=api.account_activate()
  print(account_status)
  {'accountState': 'PENDING', 'version': '2.0'}

  # To confirm that the accounts is approved, we can call accountActivate again.
  account_status=api.account_activate()
  print(account_status)
  {'accountState': 'ENABLED', 'version': '2.0'}

  # From here on, you can start using the API using the stored password.
  api=PXAPI('pxgridnode.example.com','pwdclient1','','','root.cer',password)

Subscribing to pxGrid topics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ISE uses web sockets as a mechanism for exchange real-time data with pxGrid clients  
When data is received from ISE, the api will convert it to **StompFrame** class and pass it a callback function

.. code-block:: python

  def on_message(stomp_frame):
      print(f"Command: {stomp_frame.command}")
      print(f"Headers: {json.dumps(stomp_frame.headers,indent=2)}")
      try:
          print(f"Data: {json.dumps(stomp_frame.data,indent=2)}")
      except:
          pass

  api=PXAPI('pxgridnode.example.com','client-name','client.cer','client.key','root.cer')
  api.topic_subscribe("com.cisco.ise.session","sessionTopic",on_message)

pxshell
=======

This utility is an interactive wrapper for PXAPI library. It allows interaction with pxGrid using simple CLI interface.

Installation
------------


.. code-block:: console

  # Install the module
  pip install pxgrid-api

Usage
-----

All commands are document and help can be retrived using **help <command>**

.. code-block:: console

  $ pxshell
  pxshell> help

  Documented commands (type help <topic>):
  ========================================
  accountcreate  anc     debug  mdm       radius   sxp     trustsec   
  activate       config  help   profiler  session  system  trustseccfg

  Undocumented commands:
  ======================
  EOF

  pxshell> help config
  Config options:
                  save <file>: Save config to file
                  load <file>: Load config from file
                  apply [file]: Instatiate connection to pxGrid. Optionaly load the file and apply in one step
                  show: Show current settings 
                  pxnode <hostname>: Set pxGrid PSN FQDN
                  name <clientname>: Set pxGrid client name
                  cert <certfile>: Set client certificate file name
                  key <keyfile>: Set client private key
                  root [<rootfile>]: Set root CA file. Leave out <rootfile> to disable server certificate verification

Before the utility can interface with pxGrid, it has to be configured with pxGrid information and certificates.  
Note that client side certificate and private key is not required for password based authentication. See an example below.
This is done with config command. The config can also be saved and loaded from a file. The file is in human readable json format.  
config apply command must be used to instantiate the API connection.

.. code-block:: console

  pxshell> config pxnode pxgridnode.example.com
  pxshell> config name client-name
  pxshell> config cert client.cer
  pxshell> config key client.key
  pxshell> config root root.cer
  pxshell> config show
  {'client_name': 'client-name', 'px_node': 'pxgridnode.example.com', 'client_cert_file': 'client.cer', 'client_key_file': 'client.key', 'root_ca_file': 'root.cer'}
  pxshell> config save px.cfg
  pxshell> config load px.cfg
  pxshell> config apply <--config apply command is used to create the api object with the requested parameters
  pxshell> config apply px.cfg <--config apply can load the config file in one step

Examples
~~~~~~~~

Check if account is approved in ISE

.. code-block:: console

  pxshell> activate
  {'accountState': 'ENABLED', 'version': '2.0'}

Using password based authentication

.. code-block:: console

  pxshell> config pxnode pxgridnode.example.com
  pxshell> config name pwdclient
  pxshell> config root root.cer
  pxshell> config apply
  pxshell> accountcreate
  {
    "nodeName": "pwdclient",
    "password": "Pbclmnup25NTsKul",
    "userName": "pwdclient"
  }
  Password automatically set in the config. Use config show to verify

  **** Be sure to save the config at this point to save the password ****
  pxshell> config save pwdclient.cfg

  **** Next, we request the account to be approved on ISE ****
  pxshell> config apply
  pxshell> activate
  {
    "accountState": "PENDING",
    "version": "2.0"
  }

  **** After the account is approved in ISE GUI, activate returns ENABLED ****
  pxshell> activate
  {
    "accountState": "ENABLED",
    "version": "2.0"
  }

  **** From here on, you can use all the other commands to interact with pxGrid ****
