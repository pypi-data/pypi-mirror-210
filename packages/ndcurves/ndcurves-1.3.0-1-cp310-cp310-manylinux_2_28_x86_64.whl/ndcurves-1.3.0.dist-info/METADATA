A template-based Library for creating curves of arbitrary order and dimension, eventually subject to derivative constraints. The main use of the library is the creation of end-effector trajectories for legged robots.

To do so, tools are provided to:
 - create **exact** splines of arbitrary order (that pass exactly by an arbitrary number waypoints)
 - constrain initial / end velocities and acceleration for the spline.
 - constrain take-off and landing phases to follow a straight line along a given normal (to avoid undesired collisions between the effector and the contact surface)
 - automatically handle 3d rotation of the effector.
 - create curves in SO3
 - support partial symbolic differentiation of curves. You can represent control points as linear variables, and integrate / differentiate those variable curves. You can also compute the cross product of two curves, which is relevant for centroidal dynamics.

Several type of formulation are provided:
 - Polynomials
 - Bezier
 - Hermite (only cubic hermite for now)

The library is template-based, thus generic:  the curves can be of any dimension, and can be implemented in double or float and can work with kind variables like Vector, Transform, Matrix, ...


Installation
-------------

This package is available as binary in [robotpkg](http://robotpkg.openrobots.org)

## Dependencies
* [Eigen (version >= 3.2.2)](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

## Additional dependencies for python bindings
* [Boost.Python](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/python/doc/html/index.html)
* [eigenpy](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/eigenpy)

To handle this with cmake, use the recursive option to clone the repository.
For instance, using http:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/loco-3d/ndcurves $NDCURVES_DIR
```
Where $NDCURVES_DIR is to be replaced to your selected source folder.
The library is header only, so the build only serves to build the tests and python bindings:

```sh
cd $NDCURVES_DIR && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE=ON .. && make && make test
```

Switch the BUILD_PYTHON argument to OFF if you don't want to use the python bindings of the package.

If everything went fine you should obtain the following output:
```sh
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 3
```
### Optional: Python bindings installation
To install the Python bindings first enable the `BUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE` option:
```
cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON_INTERFACE=ON ..
```

Then rebuild the library:
```
cd ${NDCURVES_DIR}/build
make && make test
```
To see example of use, you can refer to the [test file](https://github.com/loco-3d/ndcurves/blob/master/python/test/test.py)
which is rather self explanatory:

In spite of an exhaustive documentation, please refer to the C++ documentation, which mostly applies to python.

Documentation and tutorial
-------------

For the C++ / Python detailed documentation, you can consult [this pdf](https://github.com/loco-3d/ndcurves/blob/devel/doc/curves.pdf) available in the doc folder

For a python tutorial, you can refer to the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/loco-3d/ndcurves/blob/master/python/test/sandbox/test.ipynb).
The [test file](https://github.com/loco-3d/ndcurves/blob/master/python/test/test.py) is more exhaustive and rather self explanatory.
