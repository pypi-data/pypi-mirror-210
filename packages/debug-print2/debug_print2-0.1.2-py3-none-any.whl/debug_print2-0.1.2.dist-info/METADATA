# debug-print
Capture the print function and add some output information to it for easy debugging.

## why？
Is there such a situation？  
That you need to temporarily use `print` debugging in third-party packages or source code, 
but you may forget where to add `print` when thinking or jumping back and forth.  
Now you only need to install and import `debug_print` to let print output the file name and line number, 
which is more convenient for debugging.

## Install：
```shell
pip install debug-print2
```

## Usage:
Just import the file to run.
```python
import debug_print
debug_print.patch()
```
