Help: rnfhnfbasis(bnf,M): given a bnf attached to a number field K and a
 projective Z_K module M given by a pseudo-matrix, returns either a true
 HNF basis of M if one exists, or zero otherwise. If M is a polynomial with
 coefficients in K, replace it by the pseudo-matrix returned by
 rnfpseudobasis.

 of $M$ if one exists, or zero otherwise. If $M$ is a polynomial with
