Function: nextprime
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: nextprime
Prototype: G
Help: nextprime(x): smallest pseudoprime >= x.
Description:
 (gen):int        nextprime($1)
Doc: finds the smallest pseudoprime (see
 \tet{ispseudoprime}) greater than or equal to $x$. $x$ can be of any real
 type. Note that if $x$ is a pseudoprime, this function returns $x$ and not
 the smallest pseudoprime strictly larger than $x$. To rigorously prove that
 the result is prime, use \kbd{isprime}.
 \bprog
 ? nextprime(2)
 %1 = 2
 ? precprime(Pi)
 %2 = 5
 ? nextprime(-10)
 %3 = 2 \\ primes are positive
 @eprog\noindent
 Despite the name, please note that the function is not guaranteed to return
 a prime number, although no counter-example is known at present. The return
 value \emph{is} a guaranteed prime if $x \leq 2^{64}$. To rigorously prove
 that the result is prime in all cases, use \kbd{isprime}.
