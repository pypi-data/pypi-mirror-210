Function: qfbred
Section: number_theoretical
C-Name: qfbred0
Prototype: GD0,L,DGDG
Help: qfbred(x,{flag=0},{isd},{sd}): reduction of the binary
 quadratic form x. All other args. are optional. The argument isd and
 sd, if present, supply the values of floor(sqrt(d)) and sqrt(d)
 respectively, where d is the discriminant. If d<0, its value is not used
 and all references to Shanks's distance hereafter are meaningless.
 flag can be any of 0: default; 1: do a single reduction step;
Doc: reduces the binary quadratic form $x$ (updating Shanks's distance function
 $d$ if $x = [q,d]$ is and extended indefinite form).
 If $\fl$ is $1$, the function performs a single \idx{reduction} step, and
 a complete reduction otherwise.

 The arguments \var{isd}, \var{sd}, if present, supply the values of
 $\floor{\sqrt{D}}$, and $\sqrt{D}$ respectively, where $D$
 is the discriminant (this is not checked).
 If $d<0$ these values are useless.
Variant: Also available is \fun{GEN}{qfbred}{GEN x} (\fl is 0, \kbd{isd}
 and \kbd{sd} are \kbd{NULL})
