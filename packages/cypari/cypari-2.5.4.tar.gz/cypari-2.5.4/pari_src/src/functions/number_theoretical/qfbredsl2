Help: qfbredsl2(x,{isD}): reduction of the binary quadratic form x, return
 [y,g] where y is reduced and g in Sl(2,Z) is such that g.x = y; isD, if
 present, must be equal to sqrtint(D), where D > 0 is the discriminant of x.
Doc:
 reduction of the (real or imaginary) binary quadratic form $x$, return
 $[y,g]$ where $y$ is reduced and $g$ in $\text{SL}(2,\Z)$ is such that
  $g \cdot x = y$; \var{isD}, if
 present, must be equal to $\kbd{sqrtint}(D)$, where $D > 0$ is the
 discriminant of $x$.
