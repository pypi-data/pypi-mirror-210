Doc: find a real root of expression
 \var{expr} between $a$ and $b$.
 If both $a$ and $b$ are finite, the condition is that
 $\var{expr}(X=a) * \var{expr}(X=b) \le 0$. (You will get an error message
 \kbd{roots must be bracketed in solve} if this does not hold.)

 If only one between $a$ and $b$ is finite, say $a$, then $b=\pm\infty$. The
 routine will test all $b=a\pm 2^r$, with $r\geq \log_2(|a|)$ until it finds
 a bracket for the root which satisfies the abovementioned condition.

 If both $a$ and $b$ are infinite, the routine will test $0$ and all $\pm 2^r$,
 $r\geq 0$, until it finds a bracket for the root which satisfies the
 condition.

 This routine uses Brent's method and can fail miserably if \var{expr} is
 not defined in the whole of $[a,b]$ (try \kbd{solve(x=1, 2, tan(x))}).
