C-Name: hgmcoefs
Prototype: GGL
Help: hgmcoefs(H,t,n): (H,t) being a hypergeometric motive, returns the
 first n coefficients of its L-function, where Euler factors at wild primes
 are set to 1.
Doc: $(H,t)$ being a hypergeometric motive, returns the
 first $n$ coefficients of its $L$-function, where Euler factors at wild primes
 are set to 1. The argument $t$ may be replaced by $[t,\var{bad}]$
 where \var{bad} is a vector of pairs $[p,L_p]$, $p$ being a prime and $L_p$
 being the corresponding local Euler factor, overriding the default.

 If you hope that the wild Euler factors can be computed not too slowly
 from the functional equation, you can also set \kbd{L=lfunhgm(H,t)}, and then
 \kbd{lfunan(L,n)}, and then the Euler factors at wild primes should
 be correct.
