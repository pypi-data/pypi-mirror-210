Help: hyperellminimaldisc(C,{pr}): C being a nonsingular integral
 hyperelliptic model of a curve, return the minimal discrminant of an integral
 model of C.  If pr is given, it must be a list of primes and the discriminant
 is then only garanteed minimal at the elements of pr.
 C can be given either by a squarefree polynomial P such that
 C:y^2=P(x) or by a vector [P,Q] such that C:y^2+Q(x)*y=P(x) and Q^2+4P is
 squarefree.
