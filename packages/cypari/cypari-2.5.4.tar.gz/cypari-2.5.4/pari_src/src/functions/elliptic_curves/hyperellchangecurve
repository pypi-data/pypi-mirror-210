 C can be given either by a squarefree polynomial P such that

 $C$ being a nonsingular hyperelliptic model of a curve,
 apply the change of coordinate given by $m = [e, [a,b;c,d], H]$.

 If $(x,y)$ is a point on the new model, the corresponding
 point $(X,Y)$ on $C$ is given by
 $$
   X = (a*x + b) / (c*x + d), \quad
   Y = e (y + H(x)) / (c*x + d)^{g+1}.
 $$

 $C$ can be given either by a squarefree polynomial $P$ such that
 $C: y^2 = P(x)$ or by a vector $[P,Q]$ such that
 $C: y^2 + Q(x)\*y = P(x)$ and $Q^2+4\*P$ is squarefree.
