Help: hyperelldisc(X): X being a nonsingular hyperelliptic model of a curve,
 return its discriminant.
 X can be given either by a squarefree polynomial P such that
 X:y^2=P(x) or by a vector [P,Q] such that X:y^2+Q(x)*y=P(x) and Q^2+4P is
 squarefree.

 $X$ being a nonsingular hyperelliptic model of a curve,
 return its discriminant.
 $X$ can be given either by a squarefree polynomial $P$ such that
 $X: y^2 = P(x)$ or by a vector $[P,Q]$ such that
 $X: y^2 + Q(x)\*y = P(x)$ and $Q^2+4\*P$ is squarefree.
