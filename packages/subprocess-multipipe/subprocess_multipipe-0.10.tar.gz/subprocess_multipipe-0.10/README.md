# Uses subprocess.stdin.write and named pipes (Windows) to read data from / write data to a subprocess


## pip install subprocess-multipipe


Subprocess Management: This module provides a convenient way to start and manage subprocesses. 
It handles subprocess creation, communication, and termination, making it easier to execute multiple processes concurrently.
Unlike in the multiprocessing module, where the if __ name __ == '__ main __' check is necessary, it is not explicitly needed here.

Inter-Process Communication: The code facilitates communication between the main process and subprocesses using pipes. 
It abstracts away the complexities of pipe creation, reading, and writing, allowing for seamless data exchange between processes.

Asynchronous Reading: The code includes functionality for asynchronously reading from pipes. 
This ensures efficient utilization of system resources by allowing the main process
to continue execution while data is being received from subprocesses.

Serialization Support: The code supports serialization of data using either Pickle or Dill.
This enables the transfer of complex data structures between processes, 
making it suitable for scenarios where data sharing and manipulation are required.

Process Termination: The code provides a mechanism to gracefully terminate subprocesses and associated threads. 
It ensures that all resources are properly released, preventing resource leaks and unexpected behavior.

Flexibility and Customization: The code allows customization of various parameters, such as pipe names, deque size, and additional subprocess arguments. 
This flexibility enables users to adapt the code to their specific requirements and integrate it into their existing systems.

# Uses subprocess.stdin.write and named pipes (Windows) to read data from / write data to a subprocess

# this example sets up two separate threads to perform parallel image conversions from RGB to BGR (pipe1) and RGB to
# grayscale (pipe2) using inter-process communication through named pipes.
# The converted images are saved in separate output directories.


# The code begins by importing various modules
# These modules provide functionality for handling operating system operations, image processing, multi-threading,
# inter-process communication, and file manipulation.

### multipipe2.py


```python

# This code continuously checks for incoming images from stdincollection.stdin_deque,
# converts the color space of the images from RGB to BGR, and writes the processed images to the named pipe
# using the write2pipe function.

# The code enters an infinite loop with the statement while True:
#
# Inside the loop, the code checks the value of stdincollection.ran_out_of_input.
# If it is True, the code calls os._exit(1) to exit the program with a status code of 1,
#
# If stdincollection.ran_out_of_input is False, the code proceeds to the next conditional statement.
#
# The code checks if the stdincollection.stdin_deque is empty by evaluating if not stdincollection.stdin_deque.
# If it is empty, the code executes sleep(0.01) to pause the execution for a short period (10 milliseconds)
# before continuing to the next iteration of the loop.
#
# If stdincollection.stdin_deque is not empty, the code pops an item from the deque using
# stdincollection.stdin_deque.pop(). The popped item is then copied to a new variable called poppeddata.
#
# The code converts the color space of the poppeddata image from RGB to BGR using cv2.cvtColor with the
# flag cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR. The result is stored in a variable called with_changed_color.
#
# Finally, the code calls the write2pipe function, passing with_changed_color as the object to be written to the named
# pipe (back to the original process).
#
# Any exceptions that occur during the execution of the code are caught in a general Exception block,
# and the code continues to the next iteration of the loop.
